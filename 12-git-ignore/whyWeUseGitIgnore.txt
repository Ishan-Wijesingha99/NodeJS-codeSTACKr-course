Node modules tend to take up a lot of space and generally there are a lot of files.

So, ideally, we would push to github everything EXCEPT the node modules.

This is where the .gitignore file comes in.

type node_modules in the .gitignore file to ignore all files in the current folder as well as all subfolders with that name.

The files ignored by github are grey rather than white on the sidebar on vs code.

If you check the github repo for this folder, you'll see the node modules are not there!
