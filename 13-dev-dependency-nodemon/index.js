// nodemon is basically the same as live server, it will continually watch for changes we make in our index.js file, and then automatically change the terminal window

// pretty cool because you have to click on the terminal or off the file for changes to come into effect

console.log('hello world!');

console.log('what up homie');


// to stop nodemon, simply use control + C

// and obviously if you want to delete the devDependency, just use npm uninstall packageName
